# TODO: Scheduled Notifications Implementation
# 
# This file contains comprehensive guidance for implementing scheduled notification processing
# when you're ready to handle notifications with `scheduled_for` timestamps.
#
# IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
#
# 1. SCHEDULED NOTIFICATION PROCESSOR
# ===================================
# 
# @celery.task(bind=True, max_retries=2)
# def process_scheduled_notifications_task(self, request_id: str):
#     """
#     Process all notifications that have reached their scheduled time.
#     
#     BEST PRACTICES:
#     - Run every 5-10 minutes via Celery Beat
#     - Use timezone-aware datetime comparisons
#     - Batch process for efficiency
#     - Handle edge cases (expired notifications, failed recipients)
#     
#     QUERY LOGIC:
#     - Find notifications where scheduled_for <= current_time
#     - Only include notifications with PENDING recipients
#     - Exclude already expired notifications
#     - Use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate notifications
#     
#     PROCESSING FLOW:
#     1. Query notifications ready for processing
#     2. For each notification, call process_notification_task.delay()
#     3. Log processing results
#     4. Handle failures gracefully
#     """
#     pass
#
#
# 2. EXPIRED NOTIFICATION CLEANUP
# ===============================
#
# @celery.task(bind=True, max_retries=2) 
# def cleanup_expired_notifications_task(self, request_id: str):
#     """
#     Mark expired notifications as EXPIRED to maintain data consistency.
#     
#     BEST PRACTICES:
#     - Run daily (via cron or Celery Beat)
#     - Only mark PENDING recipients as EXPIRED
#     - Use bulk updates for efficiency
#     - Log cleanup statistics
#     
#     QUERY LOGIC:
#     - Find recipients where notification.expires_at <= current_time
#     - Only include recipients with PENDING status
#     - Batch update to EXPIRED status
#     """
#     pass
#
#
# 3. FAILED NOTIFICATION RETRY
# ============================
#
# @celery.task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
# def retry_failed_notifications_task(self, request_id: str, max_retry_hours: int = 24):
#     """
#     Retry notifications that failed within the retry window.
#     
#     BEST PRACTICES:
#     - Run every few hours
#     - Limit retry window (e.g., 24 hours)
#     - Reset FAILED recipients to PENDING before retrying
#     - Group by notification to avoid duplicate processing
#     - Respect notification expiration times
#     
#     RETRY LOGIC:
#     1. Find FAILED recipients within retry window
#     2. Check notification hasn't expired
#     3. Reset status to PENDING
#     4. Trigger process_notification_task.delay()
#     """
#     pass
#
#
# DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
# =========================
#
# 1. CELERY BEAT CONFIGURATION:
# -----------------------------
# from celery.schedules import crontab
# 
# CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE = {
#     'process-scheduled-notifications': {
#         'task': 'app.tasks.scheduled_notifications.process_scheduled_notifications_task',
#         'schedule': crontab(minute='*/5'),  # Every 5 minutes
#         'args': ('scheduled_processor_cron',)
#     },
#     'cleanup-expired-notifications': {
#         'task': 'app.tasks.scheduled_notifications.cleanup_expired_notifications_task', 
#         'schedule': crontab(hour=2, minute=0),  # Daily at 2 AM
#         'args': ('expired_cleanup_cron',)
#     },
#     'retry-failed-notifications': {
#         'task': 'app.tasks.scheduled_notifications.retry_failed_notifications_task',
#         'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/4'),  # Every 4 hours
#         'args': ('failed_retry_cron', 24)
#     },
# }
#
#
# 2. MONITORING & ALERTING:
# -------------------------
# - Monitor task success/failure rates
# - Alert on high failure rates
# - Track processing delays
# - Monitor notification delivery rates
#
#
# 3. DATABASE PERFORMANCE:
# ------------------------
# - Index on notifications.scheduled_for
# - Index on notifications.expires_at  
# - Index on notification_recipients.status + created_at
# - Consider partitioning by date for large volumes
#
#
# 4. ERROR HANDLING:
# ------------------
# - Use exponential backoff for retries
# - Log all failures with context
# - Implement circuit breaker pattern for external APIs
# - Handle database connection issues gracefully
#
#
# 5. TESTING STRATEGY:
# -------------------
# - Unit tests for edge cases (expired, malformed dates)
# - Integration tests with real database
# - Load tests for high-volume scenarios
# - Mock external dependencies (LINE API)
#
#
# IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
# =======================
# 
# Phase 1 (MVP): 
# - Basic scheduled notification processor
# - Simple expired notification cleanup
#
# Phase 2 (Production):
# - Failed notification retry logic
# - Comprehensive monitoring
# - Performance optimizations
#
# Phase 3 (Scale):
# - Advanced batching strategies
# - Database sharding considerations
# - Multi-region deployment support
#
#
# COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
# =========================
#
# 1. TIMEZONE ISSUES:
#    - Always use timezone-aware datetime objects
#    - Store all timestamps in UTC
#    - Convert to user timezone only for display
#
# 2. DUPLICATE PROCESSING:
#    - Use database constraints to prevent duplicates
#    - Handle race conditions between scheduled processors
#    - Consider using distributed locks for critical sections
#
# 3. MEMORY LEAKS:
#    - Close database sessions properly
#    - Limit batch sizes to prevent OOM
#    - Use streaming queries for large result sets
#
# 4. INFINITE RETRY LOOPS:
#    - Set reasonable retry limits
#    - Implement dead letter queues
#    - Monitor and alert on repeated failures
#
# 5. PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION:
#    - Optimize database queries
#    - Use connection pooling
#    - Monitor query execution times
#    - Consider read replicas for heavy queries
